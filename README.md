The Gold Price Prediction and Analysis project aims to explore, analyze, and forecast gold 
prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. Gold, as one of the most significant 
commodities in the global economy, plays a crucial role in financial markets. Its price trends often 
reflect broader economic changes, making gold price forecasting a valuable exercise for investors, 
economists, and analysts.  
This project initially began as a data-centric exploration using Jupyter Notebooks for 
cleaning, visualizing, and modeling the data. As the analysis matured through different stages, it 
culminated in the development of an interactive web dashboard that combines all insights into a 
user-friendly interface. 
The project emphasizes both analytical depth and real-world usability. It uses historical gold 
price data to identify trends, detect anomalies using clustering algorithms, and build predictive 
models to forecast future prices.  
These insights are not only presented through static plots and metrics but are later converted 
into a fully interactive web interface that supports dynamic visualizations, timeframe filtering, and 
investment recommendations. The end product aims to empower users with data-backed insights 
to support strategic decisions regarding gold investments.
